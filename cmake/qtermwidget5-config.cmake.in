# - Find the QTermWidget include and library dirs and define a some macros
#
# The module defines the following variables
#  QTERMWIDGET_FOUND         - Set to TRUE if all of the above has been found
#
#  QTERMWIDGET_INCLUDE_DIR   - The QTermWidget include directory
#
#  QTERMWIDGET_INCLUDE_DIRS  - The QTermWidget include directory
#
#  QTERMWIDGET_LIBRARIES     - The libraries needed to use QTermWidget
#
#  QTERMWIDGET_USE_FILE      - The variable QTERMWIDGET_USE_FILE is set which is the path
#                              to a CMake file that can be included to compile qtermwidget
#                              applications and libraries. It sets up the compilation
#                              environment for include directories and populates a
#                              QTERMWIDGET_LIBRARIES variable.
#
# QTERMWIDGET_QT_LIBRARIES   - The Qt libraries needed by QTermWidget
#
# Typical usage:
#    find_package(QTERMWIDGET5)
#
#    include(${QTERMWIDGET_USE_FILE})
#    add_executable(foo main.cpp)
#    target_link_libraries(foo ${QTERMWIDGET_QT_LIBRARIES} ${QTERMWIDGET_LIBRARIES})
